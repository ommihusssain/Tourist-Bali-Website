                <h3>Balinese Dance</h3>
                <p>Bali is home to a unique blend of Hindu traditions, rituals, and ceremonies. Major festivals such as Nyepi and Galungan showcase the island’s cultural depth.</p>
                <p>The audience enjoys the tales of good and evil, applauding the heroes and cringing at the evil spirits as the performances typically combine humour (in a slapstick fashion) and Hindu epic drama.
                    Beginning at age seven, Balinese dancers receive extensive training. Sacred dances, also known as wali dances, are popular dances that are performed in temple courtyards.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, there are Bebali dances performed in the middle courtyards that combine the religious and the secular. </p>

                    An annual event that takes place in the Legian beach area in mid-November, the Legian Beach Festival features cultural exhibitions that showcase the finest artwork and handicrafts produced by regional artists.
